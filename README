NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginLoader - A Plugin that loads another

VERSION
    version 0.001000

METHODS
  "mvp_aliases"
    *   "dz_plugin_arguments=" can be written as ">=" or
        "dz_plugin_argument="

  "mvp_multivalue_args"
    All of the following support multiple declaration:

    *   "dz_plugin_arguments"

    *   "prereq_to"

ATTRIBUTES
  "dz_plugin"
    REQUIRED

    The "plugin" identifier.

    For instance, "[GatherDir / Foo]" and "[GatherDir]" approximation would
    both set this field to

      dz_plugin => 'GatherDir'

  "dz_plugin_name"
    The "Name" for the "plugin".

    For instance, "[GatherDir / Foo]" would set this value as

      dz_plugin_name => "Foo"

    and "[GatherDir]" approximation would both set this field to

      dz_plugin_name => "Foo"

    In "Dist::Zilla", "[GatherDir]" is equivalent to "[GatherDir /
    GatherDir]".

    Likewise, if you do not specify "dz_plugin_name", the value of
    "dz_plugin" will be used.

  "dz_plugin_minversion"
    The minimum version of "dz_plugin" to use.

    At present, this ONLY affects "prereq" generation.

  "dz_plugin_arguments"
    A "mvp_multivalue_arg" attribute that creates an array of arguments to
    pass on to the created plugin.

    For convenience, this attribute has an alias of '>' ( mnemonic "Forward"
    ), so that the following example:

      [GatherDir]
      include_dotfiles = 1
      exclude_file = bad
      exclude_file = bad2

    Would be written

      [if]
      dz_plugin = GatherDir
      ?= $ENV{dogatherdir}
      >= include_dotfiles = 1
      >= exclude_file = bad
      >= exclude_file = bad2

    Or in crazy long form

      [if]
      dz_plugin = GatherDir
      condtion = $ENV{dogatherdir}
      dz_plugin_argument = include_dotfiles = 1
      dz_plugin_argument = exclude_file = bad
      dz_plugin_argument = exclude_file = bad2

  "dz_plugin_package"
    This is an implementation detail which returns the expanded name of
    "dz_plugin"

    You could probably find some evil use for this, but I doubt it.
