WARNINGS
  STOP
    You probably don't want to use this module. You either want a
    @PluginBundle, or "PluginLoader::Configurable"

  WHEN YOU WANT THIS MODULE
    *   You don't want a plugin bundle

    *   You want something harder to understand for people who use your
        plugin.

    *   You *EXPRESSLY* wish to hide the loaded modules from things like
        "Dist::Zilla::App::Command::bakeini"

    *   You are loading a single, or handful of modules, all of which are
        *BLATANLY* obvious *DIRECTLY* in "dist.ini", except with some
        special loading semantis.

  ADVICE
    *   Do make consuming plugins have to declare the loaded plugin somehow

    *   Do make consuming plugins able to directly configure the loaded
        plugin somehow

    *   If at all possible, load at most, one plugin.

    *   If at all possible, and you are loading only one plugin, use
        "PluginLoader::Configurable"

    *   If you have read this far, and you still are considering using this
        Role, please contact me, "kentnl" on "#distzilla@irc.perl.org", and
        let me convince you not to.
